Furthermore, it is\ndifficult to evaluate business logic in the normal manner, with a bunch of <code>ifs<\/code>, <code>switches<\/code>, and so on, when the data\nneeded to validate these constraints are often the result of API calls or database queries which should be run\nasynchronously. The result is a mess of callbacks and spaghetti code that is not typically managed well and ends up\nbeing repeated throughout the application, which makes it difficult to maintain.<\/p>\n<p><em>Trellis<\/em> provides a small type-safe interface for building objects which encapsulate and validate business logic, and a\nfluent API for combining these smaller specs into larger, more complex specs. The result is that multiple conditions can\nbe implemented as needed, but evaluating the complex spec is just the same as evaluating a small spec: just pass the\nobject to test and a callback will eventually give you the result. And since the building and testing of the spec is now\nseparated from the code that needs to validate against the spec, you can now dynamically build the spec and inject it\nwith an IoC container, giving you a clean separation of concerns in your code.<\/p>\n<p>Common use cases are for evaluating boolean logic, and for computing complex numeric logic.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://copper-leaf.github.io/trellis/wiki/trellis-core\">Trellis Core<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://copper-leaf.github.io/trellis/wiki/java-interop\">Java Interop<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https://copper-leaf.github.io/trellis/wiki/introspection\">Introspection<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https://copper-leaf.github.io/trellis/wiki/trellis-dsl\">Trellis DSL<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https://copper-leaf.github.io/trellis/wiki/boolean-logic\">Boolean Logic<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https://copper-leaf.github.io/trellis/wiki/numeric-logic\">Numeric Logic<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation<\/h2>\n<p>Install with Jitpack.<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-groovy\">repositories {\n    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }\n}\ndependencies {\n    implementation &quot;com.github.copper-leaf.trellis:trellis-core:${trellisVersion}&quot;\n    implementation &quot;com.github.copper-leaf.trellis:trellis-dsl:${trellisVersion}&quot;\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<h2 id=\"notes\">Notes<\/h2>\n<p>There is some criticism over the use of the Specification pattern, as it tends be to abused and over-used, and instead\njust becomes a poor replacement of the logic that is handled in the language itself. While this is certainly true if the\nspeks are designed to be executed synchronously, being asynchronous, as implemented in this library, gives sufficient\nmotivation to use this pattern over the programming language logic itself. It is difficult to cleanly capture\nconditional and complex logic asynchronously, but this library allows it to be done in a way that doesn't feel\nasynchronous.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, by having the desired logic encapsulated in an object, this logic can be defined and tested elsewhere and\ninjected into the appropriate places with and IoC container, helping maintain a clear separation of concerns. In\naddition, it provides a structure and reusability around this kind of logic (read: maintainability) that would not exist\notherwise.<\/p>\n<p>And lastly, by providing a DSL, Speks can be created dynamically, at runtime, without recompiling your code.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.michael-whelan.net/rules-design-pattern\">https://www.michael-whelan.net/rules-design-pattern<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.martinfowler.com/apsupp/spec.pdf\">https://www.martinfowler.com/apsupp/spec.pdf<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n"
